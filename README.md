# bashFileUtils
Bash scripts intended to be used in a Bash terminal environment to manage and manipulate files easily.

## Contents

- **ts** - Short for *Trash Size*, lists out the files in the current user's "trash" directory on Linux systems as well as the total size (in b/kb/gb) of the directory.

- **bgDir** *Biggest Directories*, will automatically find the largest directories in the user's home folder and print them from greatest to largest including folder-sizes.    
Options include -h (show help for this script) and [numberofdirectories] which adjusts the number of directories to display, ie bgDir.sh 5 will display only the top 5 directories in terms of size.
